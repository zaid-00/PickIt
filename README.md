# PickIt
The PickIt is an interactive game for kids designed to help them learn the names of common objects. The game displays an image of an object, and the player must choose the correct name from options. The game also includes sound effects to provide a hint if the player is stuck.

Built with CustomTkinter
The PickIt is built using CustomTkinter, an advanced version of the standard Tkinter library. CustomTkinter provides additional features and functionality that make it easier to create complex graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The game is written entirely in Python and uses object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
